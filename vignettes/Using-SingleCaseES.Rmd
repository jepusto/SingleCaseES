The `SingleCaseES` package provides R functions for calculating basic,
within-case effect size indices for single-case designs, including several
non-overlap measures and parametric effect size measures, and for estimating the
gradual effects model [@Swan2018gradual]. Standard errors and
confidence intervals are provided for the subset of effect sizes indices with
known sampling distributions. 

The package also includes two graphical user interfaces for interactive use (designed using
[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)), both of which
are also available as web apps hosted through
[shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/):

-   `SCD_effect_sizes()` opens an interactive calculator for the basic
    non-overlap indices and parametric effect sizes. It is also
    available at <https://jepusto.shinyapps.io/SCD-effect-sizes>
-   `shine_gem_scd()` opens an interactive calculator for the gradual
    effects model. It is also available at
    <https://jepusto.shinyapps.io/gem-scd>

In this vignette, we introduce the package's primary functions for carrying out effect size calculations. We demonstrate how to use the functions for calculating individual effect sizes from single data series, how to use the `calc_ES()` function for calculating multiple effect sizes from a single data series, and how to use `batch_calc_ES()` for calculating one or multiple effect sizes from multiple data series. We also highlight some further options available for the parametric effect size functions.

To start, be sure to load the package:

```{r}
library(SingleCaseES)
```


# Individual effect size functions

The `SingleCaseES` package includes functions for calculating the major non-overlap measures that have been proposed for use with single-case designs, as well as several parametric effect size measures. The following non-overlap measures are available (function names are listed in parentheses):

-   Percentage of non-overlapping data (`PND`)
-   Percentage of all non-overlapping data (`PAND`)
-   Robust improvement rate difference (`IRD`)
-   Percentage exceeding the median (`PEM`)
-   Non-overlap of all pairs (`NAP`)
-   Tau non-overlap (`Tau`)
-   Tau-U, which includes baseline trend adjustment (`Tau_U`)

The following parametric effect sizes are available:

-   Within-case standardized mean difference (`SMD`)
-   The increasing and decreasing versions of the log response ratio (`LRRi` and `LRRd`)
-   Log odds ratio (`LOR`)

All of the functions for calculating individual effect sizes follow the same basic syntax. For demonstration purposes, let's take a look at the syntax for `NAP()`, which calculates the non-overlap of all pairs [@parker2009improved]:

```{r}
args(NAP)
```

All of the effect sizes functions in `SingleCaseES` can take the data from a
single SCD series in one of two formats. We will first
demonstrate each of these methods, then explain the further arguments to the
function.

## Using the `A_data`, `B_data` inputs

The first input format involves providing separate vectors for the data from each phase. 
Here is some hypothetical data from the A phase and B phase of a single-case data series: 

```{r}
A <- c(20, 20, 26, 25, 22, 23)
B <- c(28, 25, 24, 27, 30, 30, 29)
```

We can feed these data into the `NAP` function as follows:
```{r}
NAP(A_data = A, B_data = B)
```

## Using the `condition`, `outcome` inputs

The second input format involves providing a single vector containing _all_ of the outcome data from the series, along with a vector that describes the phase of each observation in the data. Here we re-format the hypothetical data above to follow this structure:

```{r}
phase <- c(rep("A", 6), rep("B", 7))
phase

outcome_dat <- c(A, B)
outcome_dat 
NAP(condition = phase, outcome = outcome_dat)
```

Note that if the vector provided to `condition` has more than two values,
the effect size function will throw an error:

```{r}
phase2 <- c(rep("A", 5), rep("B", 5), rep("C",3))
NAP(condition = phase2, outcome = outcome_dat)
```

By default, `NAP()` and all of the other effect size functions treat the first value of
`condition` as the the baseline phase. However, in some single-case data series, the initial observation might not be in the
baseline phase. For example, an SCD with four cases might use a cross-over treatment reversal design, where two of the cases follow an ABAB design and the other two cases follow a BABA design. To handle this situation, we will need to specify the baseline phase using the `baseline_phase` argument:

```{r}
phase_rev <- c(rep("B", 7), rep("A", 6))
outcome_rev <- c(B, A)
NAP(condition = phase_rev, outcome = outcome_rev, baseline_phase = "A")
```

## Direction of improvement 

All of the effect size functions in `SingleCaseES` are defined based on some assumption about the direction of therapeutic improvement in the outcome (e.g., improvement would correspond to _increases_ in on-task behavior but _decreases_ in aggressive behavior). For all of the effect size functions, it is important to specify the direction of therapeutic improvement for the data series by providing a value for the `improvement` argument:

```{r}
NAP(A_data = A, B_data = B, improvement = "decrease")
```

Note that `NAP()` and most of the effect size functions default to assuming that increases in the outcome correspond to improvements.  

## Further options for `NAP()`

The `NAP` function provides several possible methods for calculating the standard 
error. By default, the exactly unbiased standard errors are used. However, the 
function can also produce standard errors using the Hanley-McNeil estimator, 
the variance under the null hypothesis of no effect, or no standard errors at all:

```{r}
NAP(A_data = A, B_data = B, SE = "unbiased")

NAP(A_data = A, B_data = B, SE = "Hanley")

NAP(A_data = A, B_data = B, SE = "null")

NAP(A_data = A, B_data = B, SE = "none")
```

The function also produces a confidence interval for NAP. By default, a 95% CI is calculated.
To calculate an interval at some other level of coverage, set the `confidence` argument to a value between 0 and 1:

```{r}
NAP(A_data = A, B_data = B)

NAP(A_data = A, B_data = B, confidence = .99)

NAP(A_data = A, B_data = B, confidence = .90)
```

Set `confidence = NULL` to omit the confidence interval calculations all together:

```{r}
NAP(A_data = A, B_data = B, confidence = NULL)    
```

## Other non-overlap indices

The `SingleCaseES` package includes functions for calculating several other
non-overlap indices in addition to NAP. All of the functions accept data in either the
A, B format or the condition, outcome format with optional baseline 
specification, and all of the functions include an argument to specify the direction of improvement. Like the
function for NAP, the function for Tau (`Tau`) can produce unbiased standard
errors, Hanley-McNeil standard errors, standard errors under the null hypothesis 
of no effect, or no standard errors at all. Only `NAP` and `Tau` return standard errors and confidence intervals. The remaining non-overlap measures return only a point estimate:

```{r}
Tau(A_data = A, B_data = B)

PND(A_data = A, B_data = B)

PEM(A_data = A, B_data = B)

PAND(A_data = A, B_data = B)

IRD(A_data = A, B_data = B)

Tau_U(A_data = A, B_data = B)
```

## Further options for `SMD()`

The standardized mean difference parameter is defined as the difference between 
the mean level of the outcome in phase B and the mean level of the outcome in 
phase A, scaled by the within-case standard deviation of the outcome in phase A.
As with all functions discussed so far, the `SMD()` function accepts data in either
the A_data, B_data format or the condition, outcome format with optional
baseline phase specification.

The direction of improvement can be specified with the `improvement` argument,
with "increase" being the default. Changing the direction of the improvement
does not change the magnitude of the effect size, but does change its sign:

```{r}
A <- c(20, 20, 26, 25, 22, 23)
B <- c(28, 25, 24, 27, 30, 30, 29)

SMD(A_data = A, B_data = B, improvement = "increase")

SMD(A_data = A, B_data = B, improvement = "decrease")
```

The `std_dev` argument controls whether the effect size estimate is based on the standard 
deviation of the baseline phase alone (the default, `std_dev = "baseline"`),
or based on the standard deviation after pooling across both phases (`std_dev = "pool"`):

```{r}
SMD(A_data = A, B_data = B, std_dev = "baseline")
SMD(A_data = A, B_data = B, std_dev = "pool")
```

By default the `SMD()` function uses the Hedges' g bias correction for
small sample sizes. The bias correction can be turned off by specifying the argument 
`bias_correct = FALSE`. The width of the confidence intervals is controlled via 
the `confidence` argument, and no confidence intervals will be produced if the 
argument is set to `confidence = NULL`.

## Log response ratios

The response ratio parameter is the ratio of the mean level of the outcome
during phase B to the mean level of the outcome during phase A. The log response
ratio is the natural logarithm of the response ratio. This effect size is
appropriate for outcomes measured on a ratio scale, such that zero corresponds to
the true absence of the outcome. 

The package includes two versions of the LRR:

- LRR-increasing (`LRRi()`) is defined so that positive values correspond to
therapeutic improvements
- LRR-decreasing (`LRRd()`) is defined so that negative values correspond to therapeutic improvements.

If you are estimating an effect size for a single series, pick the version of
LRR that corresponds to the therapeutic improvement expected for your dependent
variable. Similarly, if you are estimating effect sizes for a set of SCD series
with the same therapeutic direction, pick the version that corresponds to your
intervention's expected change.

If you are estimating effect sizes for interventions where the direction of
improvement depends upon the series or study, the choice between LRRi and LRRd
is slightly more involved. For example, imagine we have ten studies to
meta-analyze. For eight studies, the outcome are initiations of peer
interaction, so therapeutic improvements correspond to increases in behavior.
For the other two studies, the outcomes were episodes of verbal aggression
towards peers, so the therapeutic direction was a decrease. In this context it
would be sensible to pick the `LRRi()` function, because most of the outcomes
are positively-valenced. For the final two studies, we would specify
`improvement = "decrease"`, which would ensure that the sign and magnitude of
the outcomes were consistent with the direction of therapeutic improvement (i.e.
a larger log-ratio represents a larger change in the desired direction).
Conversely, if most of the outcomes had a negative valence and only a few had a
positive valence, then we would use `LRRd()` and we would specify `improvement =
"increase"` for the few series that had positive-valence outcomes.

### Setting the scale of the outcome

LRR differs from other effect size indices for single-case designs in that
calculating it requires some further information about how the outcome variable
was measured. One important piece of information to know is the scale of the
outcome measurements. For outcomes that are measured by frequency counting, the
scale might be expressed as a raw count (`scale = "count"`) or as a standardized
rate per minute (`scale = "rate"`). For outcomes that are measures of state
behavior, where the main dimension of interest is the proportion of time that
the behavior occurs, the scale might be expressed as a percentage (ranging from
0 to 100%; `scale = "percentage"`) or as a proportion (ranging from 0 to 1;
`scale = "proportion"`). For outcomes that don't fit into any of these
categories, set `scale = "other"`.

The scale of the outcome variable has two important implications for how log
response ratios are estimated. First, outcomes measured as percentages or
proportions need to be coded so that the direction of therapeutic improvement is
consistent with the direction of the effect size. Consequently, changing the
improvement direction will alter the _magnitude_, in addition to the sign, of
the effect size [see @pustejovsky2018using, pp. 16-18 for further details]. Here
is an example:

```{r}
A <- c(20, 20, 26, 25, 22, 23)
B <- c(28, 25, 24, 27, 30, 30, 29)
LRRi(A_data = A, B_data = B, scale = "percentage")

LRRi(A_data = A, B_data = B, improvement = "decrease", scale = "percentage")
```

Note that if the outcome is a count (the default for both LRR functions) or rate, changing 
the improvement direction merely changes the sign of the effect size: 

```{r}
A <- c(20, 20, 26, 25, 22, 23)
B <- c(28, 25, 24, 27, 30, 30, 29)
LRRi(A_data = A, B_data = B, scale = "count")
LRRi(A_data = A, B_data = B, scale = "count", improvement = "decrease")
```

The scale of the outcome has one further important implication. To account for the
possibility of a sample mean of zero, the `LRRd()` and `LRRi()` functions use a truncated sample mean, where
the truncation level is determined by the scale of the outcome and some further details of how the outcomes were measured.
For rates, the truncated mean requires specifying the 
length of the observation session in minutes:

```{r}
A <- c(0, 0, 0, 0)
B <- c(28, 25, 24, 27, 30, 30, 29)
LRRd(A_data = A, B_data = B, scale = "rate")
LRRd(A_data = A, B_data = B, scale = "rate", observation_length = 30)
```

If no additional information is provided and there is a sample mean of 0, the function
returns a value of `NaN`. 

For outcomes specified as percentages or proportions, the argument `intervals`
must be supplied. For interval recording methods such as partial interval
recording or momentary time sampling, provide the number of intervals. For
continuous recording, set `intervals` equal to 60 times the length of the observation
session in minutes: 

```{r}
LRRd(A_data = A, B_data = B, scale = "percentage")
LRRd(A_data = A, B_data = B, scale = "percentage", intervals = 180)
```

You can also specify your own value for the constant used to truncate the sample
mean by supplying a value for `D_const`. If a vector, the mean will be used.

### Additional arguments 

Both LRR functions return a effect size that has been bias-corrected for small
sample sizes by default. To omit the bias correction, set `bias_correct = FALSE`. 
Finally, as with the non-overlap measures, the `confidence` argument
can be used to change the default 95% confidence interval, or set to `NULL`
to omit confidence interval calculations.

## Log-odds ratios

The odds ratio parameter is the ratio of the odds that the outcome occurs during
phase B to the odds that the outcome occurs during phase A. The log-odds ratio
(LOR) is the natural logarithm of the odds ratio. This effect size is
appropriate for outcomes measured on a percentage or proportion scale. The
`LOR()` function works almost identically to the `LRRi()` and `LRRd()` functions, but
there are a few exceptions.

The `LOR()` function accepts only outcomes that are on proportion or 
percentage scales:

```{r}
A_pct <- c(20, 20, 25, 25, 20, 25)
B_pct <- c(30, 25, 25, 25, 35, 30, 25)

LOR(A_data = A_pct, B_data = B_pct, scale = "percentage")

LOR(A_data = A_pct/100, B_data = B_pct/100, scale = "proportion")

LOR(A_data = A_pct, B_data = B_pct, scale = "count")

LOR(A_data = A_pct, B_data = B_pct, scale = "proportion")

```

As with the LRR functions, `LOR()` includes an argument to specify the direction
of therapeutic improvement, with the default assumption being that a therapeutic
improvement is an increase in the behavior. In contrast to LRRi and LRRd,
changing the direction of therapeutic improvement only reverses the sign of the LOR,
but does not change its absolute magnitude:

```{r}
LOR(A_data = A_pct, B_data = B_pct,
    scale = "percentage", improvement = "increase")

LOR(A_data = A_pct, B_data = B_pct,
    scale = "percentage", improvement = "decrease")
```

Similar to the LRR functions, `LOR()` will be calculated using truncated sample
means for cases where phase means are close to the extremes of the scale. To use
truncated means, the number of intervals per observation session must be
specified using the `intervals` argument:

```{r}
LOR(A_data = c(0,0,0), B_data = B_pct,
   scale = "percentage")
LOR(A_data = c(0,0,0), B_data = B_pct,
    scale = "percentage", intervals = 20)
```

For data measured using continuous recording, set the number of intervals equal
to 60 times the length of the observation session in minutes.

Like the LRR functions, it is possible to specify your own truncation constant
using the `D_const` argument. By default the `LOR()` function uses a bias
correction for small sample sizes, but this can be turned off by specifying the
argument `bias_correct = FALSE`. The width of the confidence intervals is
controlled via the `confidence` argument; set the argument to `confidence =
NULL` to omit the confidence interval calculations.

# calc_ES()

The `calc_ES()` function will calculate multiple effect sizes estimates for a
single SCD series. As with the individual effect size functions, `calc_ES()`
accepts data in either the `A_data`, `B_data` format or the `condition`, `outcome` format. 
To calculate multiple effect size estimates, provide a list of effect sizes to the `ES` argument.
Here we use the `A_data`, `B_data` format:

```{r}
A <- c(20, 20, 26, 25, 22, 23)
B <- c(28, 25, 24, 27, 30, 30, 29)
calc_ES(A_data = A, B_data = B, ES = c("NAP","PND","Tau-U"))
```

Here is the same calculation in the `condition`, `outcome` format:

```{r}
phase <- c(rep("A", length(A)), rep("B", length(B)))
outcome <- c(A, B)
calc_ES(condition = phase, outcome = outcome, baseline_phase = "A", 
        ES = c("NAP","PND","Tau-U"))
```

The `ES` argument can include any of the following metrics: `"LRRd"`, `"LRRi"`, `"LOR"`, `"SMD"`, `"NAP"`, 
`"PND"`, `"PEM"`, `"PAND"`, `"IRD"`, `"Tau"`, or `"Tau-U"`.

Setting `ES = "all"` will return all available effect sizes:

```{r}
calc_ES(A_data = A, B_data = B, ES = "all")
```

`ES = "NOM"` will return all of the non-overlap measures:

```{r}
calc_ES(A_data = A, B_data = B, ES = "NOM")
```

and `ES = "parametric"` will return all of the parametric effect sizes: 

```{r}
calc_ES(A_data = A, B_data = B, ES = "parametric")
```

If the `ES` argument is omitted, `calc_ES()` will return LRRd, LRRi, SMD, and Tau by default. 

## Further arguments

All of the individual effect size functions have the further argument `improvement`, and several of them also have further optional arguments. Include these arguments in `calc_ES()` in order to pass them on to the individual effect size calculation functions. For example, we can set the direction of improvement to `decrease`: 

```{r}
calc_ES(A_data = A, B_data = B, ES = "NOM", improvement = "decrease")

```

To omit the confidence interval calculations for NAP and Tau, we can include the argument `confidence = NULL`:

```{r}
calc_ES(A_data = A, B_data = B, ES = "NOM", improvement = "decrease", confidence = NULL)

```

Details such as the measurement scale can also be passed on to functions that will make use of them:

```{r}
calc_ES(A_data = A, B_data = B, ES = "parametric", scale = "count")
```

Any additional arguments will be used in the calculation of effect sizes for which they are relevant and will be ignored if they are not relevant. 

## Long vs. wide format

Finally, `calc_ES()` includes an option to change the format of the output. The
function defaults to `format = "long"`; setting `format = "wide"` will return
all of the results as a single line, rather than one line per effect size:

```{r}
calc_ES(A_data = A, B_data = B, ES = c("NAP","PND","SMD"))

calc_ES(A_data = A, B_data = B, ES = c("NAP","PND","SMD"), format = "wide")
```

# batch_calc_ES()

Most single-case studies include multiple cases, and many also include multiple
dependent variables measured on each case. Thus, it will often be of interest to
calculate effect size estimates for _multiple_ data series from a study, or even
from multiple studies. The `batch_calc_ES()` function does exactly
this---calculating any of the previously detailed effect sizes for each of
several data series. Its syntax is a bit more involved than the previous
functions, and so we provide several examples here. This section of the vignette
assumes that you are already comfortable using the `es_calc()` function as well
as the other individual effect size functions in the package.

## Data organization

Unlike with the other functions in the package, the
input data for `batch_calc_ES()` must be organized in a data frame, with one line corresponding to
each observation within a series, and columns corresponding to different
variables (e.g. outcome, phase, session number). One or more variables must be
included that uniquely identify every data series. Let's look at two examples.

### McKissick

The `McKissick` dataset is data drawn from
@McKissick2010randomizing, a single-case design study of a group contingency
intervention. The study used a multiple baseline design across three
classrooms. The outcome data are event counts of disruptive behaviors observed
at the classroom level. 

```{r}
data(McKissick)
```

Here are the first few rows of the data:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(McKissick, n = 10))
```


### Schmidt (2007)

The `Schmidt2007` dataset are data drawn from @Schmidt2007effects. This data set
is somewhat more complicated. It has two outcomes for each participant, and the outcomes differ in directions of therapeutic improvement and measurement scale. The study used an ABAB design, replicated across three participants. Each series therefore has four phases: a baseline phase, a treatment phase, a return to baseline phase, and a second treatment phase.

```{r}
data(Schmidt2007)
```

Here are the first few rows of the data

```{r, echo = F}
knitr::kable(head(Schmidt2007[,c("Case_pseudonym", "Behavior_type", "Session_number", "Outcome", "Condition", "Phase_num", "Metric", "Session_length", "direction", "n_Intervals")], n = 10), longtable = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%")
```

The Schmidt (2007) dataset contains many variables, but for now let's focus on the following:

- `Case_Pseudonym` uniquely identifies each of the three participants
- `Behavior_type` specifies whether the outcome is disruptive behavior or on-task behavior
- `Session_number` specifies the order of the sessions within each data series
- `Outcome` contains the dependent variable measurements
- `Condition` specifies whether the outcome is in a baseline ("A") condition or a treatment ("B") condition 
- `Phase_num` specifies whether the session is in the first or second pair of phases in  the design
- `Metric` specifies whether the dependent variable is percentage or count data
- `Session_length` specifies the length of the observation session
-  `direction` specifies the direction of therapeutic improvement
- `n_Intervals` specifies the number of intervals per session for the dependent variable measured using partial interval recording.

## Core Arguments

Here are the arguments for the batch calculator function:

```{r}
args(batch_calc_ES)
```

This function has a bunch of arguments, but many of them are optional and only used for certain effect size metrics. For the moment, let's focus on the first few arguments, which are all we need to get going:

- The argument `dat` should be a dataframe containing all of the observations 
for all of the data series of interest. 

- The `grouping` argument should specify the set of variables that uniquely
identify each series. For a single study consisting of several series, like the
McKissick dataset, this might simply be a variable name that identifies the
participant pseudonym. Specify using bare variable names (i.e., without quotes).

- The `condition` argument should be the variable that identifies the treatment
condition for each observation in the series. The values for the baseline and
treatment phases should be uniform across all of the series within a dataset. So
if some series had "0" as baseline and "1" as treatment, whereas other series
had "A" as baseline and "B" as treatment, you'll first need to clean your data
and standardize the coding before using the `batch_calc_ES()` function. Specify
using a bare variable name.

- The `outcome` argument should be the variable that contains the outcomes of
interest. Specify using a bare variable name.

- The `ES` argument, which specifies which effect sizes are desired, is theoretically optional. By default, the batch calculator produces LRRd, LRRi, SMD, and Tau. However, you're probably going to want to specify your own effect sizes. Like `calc_ES`, you request your desired effect sizes as a character vector, with the individual options of `"LRRd"`, `"LRRi"`, `"LOR"`, `"SMD"`, `"NAP"`, 
`"PND"`, `"PEM"`, `"PAND"`, `"IRD"`, `"Tau"`, or `"Tau-U"`, in addition to `"all"` for all effect sizes, `"NOM"` for all non-overlap measures, and `"parametric"` for all parametric effect sizes.

All of the other arguments are truly optional, and we'll introduce them as we go
along. 

## Using grouping variables

Let's try applying the function to the McKissick data. Remember that these data contains a pseudonym for each case (`Case_pseudonym`), a variable (`Condition`) identifying the baseline ("A")
and treatment ("B") phases, and an outcome variable containing the values of
the outcomes. The outcomes are disruptive behaviors, so a decrease in the behavior
corresponds to therapeutic improvement. Just as with the `calc_ES()` function,
we'll need to specify that using the `improvement` argument. For now, we'll focus
on getting estimates for NAP and PND, they are relatively simple.

```{r}
mckissick_ES <- batch_calc_ES(dat = McKissick,
              grouping = Case_pseudonym, 
              condition = Condition,
              outcome = Outcome, 
              improvement = "decrease",
              ES = c("NAP", "PND"))
```

Note that all of the inputs related to variable names are bare (i.e., no
quotes). All of the arguments in `batch_calc_ES` that accept a variable should
be specified using bare variable names. Let's take a look at a table of the output.

```{r, echo = F}
kable(mckissick_ES) 
```

The output will always tart with a column corresponding to each value from the `grouping` argument, followed by a column for each effect size. If *any* of the requested effect sizes
have standard errors and confidence intervals, there will also be columns corresponding to the standard error and the upper and lower limit. Here, PND has `NA` for each of those, because it does not have a standard error or confidence interval.

Now we can try a similar example using the Schmidt data. Remember that these data contain a pseudonym that uniquely identifies each of the three participants (`Case_Pseudonym`) as well as a variable that specifies whether the outcome is disruptive behavior or on-task behavior (`Behavior_type`), *and* this was a treatment reversal design so there were two phase pairs for each combination of case and behavior type (`Phase_num`). We're going to want an effect size for each combination of pseudonym, behavior, and phase pair. The data also have an outcome variable (`Outcome`) and a variable identifying whether it was in the baseline ("A") or treatment ("B")
phase (`Condition`). Finally, the the two different behavior types have different direction therapeutic improvement, so there is a variable called `direction` that specifies `"increase"` for on-task behavior or `"decrease"` for disruptive behavior.

```{r}
schmidt_ES <- batch_calc_ES(dat = Schmidt2007,
              grouping = c(Case_pseudonym, Behavior_type, Phase_num), 
              condition = Condition,
              outcome = Outcome, 
              improvement = direction,
              ES = c("NAP", "PND"))
```

The syntax is similar to the example with the McKissick dataset, except for two things. Here, we've provided a vector of bare variable names for `grouping` that will identify each case we want an effect size for. Instead of providing a uniform direction of improvement to the `improvement` variable, we've provided a bare variable name, `direction`, which will account for the fact that the two behavior types have different directions of therapeutic improvement. Here is a table of the output:

```{r, echo = F}
kable(schmidt_ES) %>%
   kable_styling() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "800px")
```

As before, the first three columns are the unique values from the variables supplied to `grouping`, followed by the effect sizes.

## Dealing with outcome scales.

By default, the batch calculator assumes the outcome scale is `"other"`, which
means that if a phase mean is equal to zero, the logs odd ratio or the log
response ratio will not be calculated. Like `calc_ES()`, when calculating
parametric effect sizes, you may need to specify the outcome scales as well as
things like the length of the observation session or the number of intervals in
each observation session. If these values are the same for all observations in
the dataset, it can be quite simple, like this example using the McKissick
dataset.


```{r}
mckissick_ES <- batch_calc_ES(dat = McKissick,
              grouping = Case_pseudonym, 
              condition = Condition,
              outcome = Outcome, 
              improvement = "decrease",
              scale = "count",
              observation_length = 20,
              ES = "parametric")
```

Here, we've specified the outcome scale is a count, and that each session lasted 20 minutes. Note that we get a warning about the log odds ratio. Let's take a look at the output:

```{r, echo = F}
kable(mckissick_ES)
```

Once gain, we have a column specifying which pseudonym the effect sizes is for, as well as a column specifying which effect sizes. The log odds ratio returns all `NA`s, because the log odds ratio can't be estimate for count outcomes.

Let's assume that you are interested in estimating effect sizes for data where the measurement scale, as well as measurement details like the observation length or the number of intervals varies by the series we are estimating an effect size for. Using, the Schmidt data, we can try an example like that. Remember that the Schmidt data has a variable specifying the measurement scale of the outcome (`Metric`) which is `"percentage"` for desirable behavior and `"count"` for disruptive behaviors. It also has a variable that specifies the length of the observation session (`Session_length`), and a variable that specifies the number of intervals per session for the dependent variable measured using partial interval recording (`n_Intervals`). The value of `Session_length` is `NA` for the percentage outcomes and the value of `n_Intervals` is `NA` for the count outcomes, because those details are not relevant for those outcome measurement scales. Let's try it out:

```{r}
schmidt_ES <- batch_calc_ES(dat = Schmidt2007,
              grouping = c(Case_pseudonym, Behavior_type, Phase_num), 
              condition = Condition,
              outcome = Outcome, 
              improvement = direction,
              scale = Metric,
              observation_length = Session_length,
              intervals = n_Intervals,
              ES = c("parametric"))
```

Unlike the previous example, where we specified a uniform value for the `scale` and `observation_length`, we specified a bare variable name for `scale`, `observation_length`, and the number of `intervals`. Note that we get some warnings again about the LOR effect size. Let's take a look at the output:

```{r}
kable(schmidt_ES) %>%
   kable_styling() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "800px")
```

In this case, LOR is all `NA` for the outcomes that are disruptive behaviors because those are counts and therefore the LOR isn't an appropriate effect size. However, for the percentage of on task behavior, the LOR *was* estimated.

## Further arguments

We can also request the effect sizes in a wide format:

```{r}
mckissick_wide_ES <- batch_calc_ES(dat = McKissick,
              grouping = Case_pseudonym, 
              condition = Condition,
              outcome = Outcome, 
              improvement = "decrease",
              ES = c("NAP", "PND"),
              format = "wide")
```

The default argument for the batch calculator is `format = "long"`, but if you want each case to be on a single line, specifying `format = "wide"` will provide the output that way, just like `calc_ES()`. Here's the output:

```{r, echo = F}
kable(mckissick_wide_ES)
```

In this case there is a column for NAP, NAP's standard error, and the upper and
lower bound of the confidence interval. PND only has a column for the estimate,
but remember that the values for SE and upper and lower CI were all `NA` in the
long format. Any column that would simply contain `NA` is removed when
specifying `format = "wide"`.

Remember how, when we asked for the LOR for counts, the calculator gave us a bunch of warning messages? If you're asking for the LOR, and some of your outcomes are in a scale other than percentage or proportion, and you don't want to see a bunch of warnings, you can specify the argument `warn = "FALSE"` (by default it is set to `TRUE`). You will still get NA for any series with an inappropriate outcome scale, but it will suppress the warning messages.

```{r}
batch_calc_ES(dat = McKissick,
              grouping = Case_pseudonym, 
              condition = Condition,
              outcome = Outcome, 
              improvement = "decrease",
              scale = "count",
              observation_length = 20,
              ES = "LOR",
              warn = FALSE)
```


The `...` argument allows for arguments particular to an individual function such as `std_dev` 
for the `SMD()` function to be passed to that function to change its default
behavior.

```{r}
batch_calc_ES(dat = McKissick, 
              grouping = Case_pseudonym, 
              condition = Condition,
              outcome = Outcome, 
              ES = c("LRRd", "SMD"), 
              improvement = "decrease",
              scale = Procedure, 
              observation_length = Session_length)

batch_calc_ES(dat = McKissick, 
              grouping = Case_pseudonym, 
              condition = Condition,
              outcome = Outcome, 
              ES = c("LRRd", "SMD"), 
              improvement = "decrease",
              scale = Procedure, 
              observation_length = Session_length,
              std_dev = "pool", 
              bias_correct = FALSE)
```

Note that arguments common to several functions, such as `bias_correct` cannot be specified differently for different effect size functions. If you wanted bias corrected values for the LRRd effect size and not for the SMD effect size, you would need to call `batch_calc_ES()` separately for the two different effect sizes.

The `session_number` argument orders the data within each series by the specified
variable. This argument is only important if Tau-U is being calculated, because it adjusts for trend in the baseline and so the ordering of the baseline phase is important. For any other effect size, you don't need to specify this argument.

The `baseline_phase` argument works in a similar way the `calc_ES()` argument. If nothing is specified, the first phase in each series will be treated as the baseline phase. However, if the baseline phase is not always the first phase in each series, such as an SCD with four cases that use a cross-over treatment reversal design, where two of the cases follow an ABAB design and the other two cases follow a BABA design, specifying the `baseline_phase` in the same way as the `calc_ES()` function is necessary.

The `confidence` argument controls the confidence intervals in the same way as all
the other functions.
