\title{A function to estimate the gradual effects model for an SCD}
\usage{
gem_scd(Trt, outcome, m, fam)
}
\arguments{
\item{Trt}{A vector of treatment assignments where 0 = untreated and 1 = treated.}

\item{outcome}{A vector of outcomes.}

\item{m}{The number of treatment occasions to estimate a treatment effect for.}

\item{fam}{A description of the error distribution and link function to be used in the model. 
This can be supplied in any way that `glm` will accept. (See \code{\link[stats]{family}} 
for details of family functions.)}
}
\value{
`greff_glm` returns an object of class "glm." In addition to containing what
a glm normally contains, it also contains an estimate of `omega` and a variance
covariance matrix called `varcov`.
