\title{Non-overlap of all pairs}
\usage{
NAP(A_data, B_data, condition, outcome, baseline_phase,
  improvement = "increase", SE = "unbiased", CI = TRUE,
  confidence = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{A_data}{vector of numeric data for A phase. Missing values are dropped.}

\item{B_data}{vector of numeric data for B phase. Missing values are dropped.}

\item{condition}{vector identifying the treatment condition for each
observation in the series.}

\item{outcome}{vector of outcome data for the entire series.}

\item{baseline_phase}{character string specifying which value of
\code{condition} corresponds to the baseline phase. Defaults to first
observed value of \code{condition}.}

\item{improvement}{character string indicating direction of improvement.
Default is "increase"}

\item{SE}{character value indicating which formula to use for calculating the
standard error of NAP, with possible values \code{"unbiased"} for the
exactly unbiased estimator, \code{"Hanley"} for the Hanley-McNeil
estimator, or \code{"none"} to not calculate a standard error. Defaults to
"unbiased".}

\item{CI}{logical value indicating whether to report a confidence interval}

\item{confidence}{confidence level for the reported interval estimate}
}
\value{
A data.frame containing the estimate, standard error, and/or confidence
  interval.
}
\description{
Calculates the non-overlap of all pairs index (Parker & Vannest,
  2009).
}
\details{
NAP is calculated as the proportion of all pairs of one observation
  from each phase in which the measurement from the B phase improves upon the
  measurement from the A phase, with pairs of data points that are exactly
  tied being given a weight of 0.5. The range of NAP is [0,1], with a null
  value of 0.5.

  The standard error of NAP is calculated based on the method of Hanley and
  McNeil (1982).

  The confidence interval for NAP is calculated based on the symmetrized
  score-inversion method (Method 5) proposed by Newcombe (2006).

\examples{
A <- c(20, 20, 26, 25, 22, 23)
B <- c(28, 25, 24, 27, 30, 30, 29)
NAP(A_data = A, B_data = B)

# Example from Parker & Vannest (2009)
yA <- c(4, 3, 4, 3, 4, 7, 5, 2, 3, 2)
yB <- c(5, 9, 7, 9, 7, 5, 9, 11, 11, 10, 9)
NAP(yA, yB)
