\description{
Calculates the increasing or decreasing version of the
  log-response ratio effect size index, with or without bias correction
  (Pustejovsky, 2015)
}
\details{
The response ratio parameter is the ratio of the mean level of the
  outcome during phase B to the mean level of the outcome during phase A. The
  log response ratio is the natural logarithm of the response ratio. This
  effect size is appropriate for outcomes measured on a ratio scale (so that
  zero corresponds to the true absence of the outcome. There are two versions
  of the LRR. The LRR-increasing (\code{LRRi}) is defined so that positive values
  correspond to therapeutic improvements. The LRR-decreasing (\code{LRRd}) is
  defined so that negative values correspond to therapeutic improvments. For
  outcomes measured as frequency counts or rates, the two versions will have
  the same magnitude but opposite sign; for outcomes measured as percentages
  or proportions, the LRRd and LRRi will differ in both sign and magnitude
  (Pustejovsky, 2018).

  Without bias correction, the log response ratio is estimated as the natural
  logarithm of the phase B sample mean, minus the natural logarithm of the
  phase A sample mean. A delta-method bias correction to the estimator is
  used by default.

  The standard error of LRR is calculated based on a delta-method
  approximation, allowing for the possibility of different degrees of
  dispersion in each phase. The confidence interval for LRR is based on a
  large-sample (z) approximation.

  To account for the possibility of sample means of zero, a truncated mean is
  calculated following the method described in Pustejovsky (2018). The
  truncation constant depends on the scale of the outcome, the length of the
  observation sessions used to measure the dependent variable, and (for
  interval recording procedures) the total number of intervals per session
  (or the total number of items for other percentage/proportion scales). The
  argument \code{scale} must be specified in order to calculate an
  appropriate truncation constant. For standardized rates, the argument
  \code{observation_length} must also be specified; for percentages or
  proportions, the argument \code{intervals} must be specified. For outcomes
  measured using continuous recording procedures, set \code{intervals} equal
  to 60 times the length of the observation session in minutes.
