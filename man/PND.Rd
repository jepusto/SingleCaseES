\title{Percentage of non-overlapping data}
\usage{
PND(A_data, B_data, improvement = "increase")
}
\arguments{
\item{A_data}{vector of numeric data for A phase. Missing values are dropped.}

\item{B_data}{vector of numeric data for B phase. Missing values are dropped.}

\item{improvement}{character string indicating direction of improvement.
Default is "increase"}
}
\value{
Numeric value
}
\description{
Calculates the percentage of non-overlapping data index 
  (Scruggs, Mastropieri, & Castro, 1987).
}
\details{
For an outcome where increase is desirable, PND is calculated as the
  proportion of observations in the B phase that exceed the highest 
  observation from the A phase. For an outcome where decrease is desirable, 
  PND is the proportion of observations in the B phase that are less than the
  lowest observation from the A phase. The range of PND is [0,1].

\examples{
A <- c(20, 20, 26, 25, 22, 23)
B <- c(28, 25, 24, 27, 30, 30, 29)
PND(A_data = A, B_data = B)
