\title{Calculate effect sizes from a dataset for multiple series}
\usage{
batch_calc_ES(dat, grouping_vars, condition, outcome, session_number,
  baseline_phase = NULL, ES = c("LRRd", "LRRi", "SMD", "Tau"),
  improvement = "increase", scale = NA, intervals = NA,
  observation_length = NA, ..., confidence = 0.95, format = "long",
  warn = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{A dataframe containing SCD series for which effect sizes will be
calculated.}

\item{grouping_vars}{A vector of strings of the names of the variables that
uniquely identify each series (e.g. pseudonym, outcome type, study)}

\item{condition}{A string containing the variable name that identifies the
treatment condition for each observation in the series.}

\item{outcome}{A string containing the variable name of the outcome data.}

\item{session_number}{A string containing the name of a variable used to
order outcomes within each series.}

\item{baseline_phase}{character string specifying which value of
\code{condition} corresponds to the baseline phase. If \code{NULL} (the
default), the first observed value of \code{condition} within the series
will be used.
@param ES character string or character vector specifying which effect size
index or indices to calculate. Available effect sizes are \code{"LRRd"},
\code{"LRRi"}, \code{"LOR"}, \code{"SMD"}, \code{"NAP"}, \code{"IRD"},
\code{"PND"}, \code{"PEM"}, \code{"PAND"}, \code{"Tau"}, and
\code{"Tau-U"}. Set to \code{"all"} for all available effect sizes. Set to
\code{"parametric"} for all parametric effect sizes. Set to \code{"NOM"}
for all non-overlap measures. Defaults to calculating the LRRd, LRRi, SMD,
and Tau indices.}

\item{ES}{character string or character vector specifying which effect size
index or indices to calculate. Available effect sizes are \code{"LRRd"},
\code{"LRRi"}, \code{"LOR"}, \code{"SMD"}, \code{"NAP"}, \code{"IRD"},
\code{"PND"}, \code{"PEM"}, \code{"PAND"}, \code{"Tau"}, and
\code{"Tau-U"}. Set to \code{"all"} for all available effect sizes. Set to
\code{"parametric"} for all parametric effect sizes. Set to \code{"NOM"}
for all non-overlap measures. Defaults to calculating the LRRd, LRRi, SMD,
and Tau indices.}

\item{improvement}{character string either indicating the direction of
uniform improvement ("increase" or "decrease") or the variable name of a
variable identifying the direction of improvement for each series. Default
is "increase".}

\item{scale}{character string indicating the common scale of the outcome
variable across all of the series in the data set or the name of a variable
within the dataset that identifies the outcome scale within each series.
Possible values for the scale are \code{"percentage"} for a percentage with
range 0-100, \code{"proportion"} for a proportion with range 0-1,
\code{"count"} for a frequency count (0 or positive integers),
\code{"rate"} for a standardized rate per minute. If a vector, the most
frequent unique value will be used and missing values will be ignored.
Defaults to \code{NA}.}

\item{intervals}{for interval recording procedures. Either the total number
of intervals per observation session common to all series in the dataset,
or the name of a variable within the dataset that identifies the number of
intervals for each observation. If a variable name, the mean number of
intervals within each series will be used. Missing values will be ignored.
Defaults to \code{NA}.}

\item{observation_length}{Used for the log-response ratio. Either the common
observation session length (in minutes) across all series in the dataset or
a variable name containing the observation session length for each
observation. If a variable name, the mean observation session length within
each series will be used. Missing values will be ignored. Defaults to
\code{NA}.}

\item{...}{further arguments used for calculating some of the effect size
indices.}

\item{confidence}{confidence level for the reported interval estimate. Set to
\code{NULL} to omit confidence interval calculations.}

\item{format}{character string specifying whether to organize the results in
\code{"long"} format or \code{"wide"} format. Defaults to \code{"long"}.}

\item{warn}{logical indicating whether warnings should be displayed. Default
is \code{TRUE}.}
