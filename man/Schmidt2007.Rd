\description{
Data from a study by Schmidt (2007). The variables are as follows:

\itemize{
  \item \code{Behavior_type}. Outcome measure description (disruptive behavior or on task behavior).
  \item \code{Procedure}. The observation recording procedure used to measure the outcome.  
  \item \code{Metric}. The metric in which the outcome measurement is expressed ("count" for natural counts; "percentage" for percentage of intervals)
  \item \code{Session_length}. Length (in minutes) of the observation sessions
  \item \code{Interval_length}. If an interval method was used, the length of the intervals (in seconds); \code{NA} otherwise.
  \item \code{Case_Pseudonym}. Case Pseudonym provided by the authors.
  \item \code{Session_number}. Within-series session-number.
  \item \code{Phase}. Label for each unique phase (e.g., A1 is the first baseline phase, B2 is the second treatment phase).
  \item \code{Condition}. Label indicating whether the outcome is in the baseline (A) or treatment (B) phase.
  \item \code{Outcome}. Outcome measurement.
  \item \code{Phase_num}. Indicator for each pair of baseline and treatment phases.
  \item \code{direction}. Direction of therapeutic improvement for the outcome.
  \item \code{n_Intervals}. If an interval method was used, the total number of intervals; \code{NA} otherwise.
