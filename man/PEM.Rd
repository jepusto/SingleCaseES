\usage{
PEM(
  A_data,
  B_data,
  condition,
  outcome,
  baseline_phase = unique(condition)[1],
  improvement = "increase"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{A_data}{vector of numeric data for A phase. Missing values are dropped.}

\item{B_data}{vector of numeric data for B phase. Missing values are dropped.}

\item{condition}{vector identifying the treatment condition for each
observation in the series.}

\item{outcome}{vector of outcome data for the entire series.}

\item{baseline_phase}{character string specifying which value of
\code{condition} corresponds to the baseline phase. Defaults to first
observed value of \code{condition}.}

\item{improvement}{character string indicating direction of improvement.
Default is "increase".}

\description{
Calculates the percentage exceeding the median (PEM) index (Ma, 
  2006).
}
\details{
For an outcome where increase is desirable, PEM is calculated as the
  proportion of observations in the B phase that exceed the median 
  observation from the A phase. For an outcome where decrease is desirable, 
  PEM is calculated as the proportion of observations in the B phase that are
  less than the median observation from the A phase. Ties are counted with a
  weight of 0.5. The range of PEM is [0,1].
