# Pre-loaded data info
# path describes where to find the data
# varnames are the Phase identifier variable name, Outcome variable name, and then any number of clustering variable names
# phase vals are the values corresponding to the baseline and treatment phase, respectively
# direction describes direction type
# direction_var is the name of the variable that applies the direction.
