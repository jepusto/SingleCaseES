### Accessing the calculator

There are two ways to access this tool: via a website or on your own computer, using the RStudio software. Since you are reading this now, you have presumably already figured out at least one of these. Read on to learn more about both options.

#### Access through the shinyapps.io website

The simplest way to access the simulator is via the web, at https://jepusto.shinyapps.io/SCD-effect-sizes/. This version of the calculator is hosted by a service called [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/), which imposes limitations on the number of concurrent users of the site and total hours of active use of the site. Consequently, you might find that the site is not always available. If you intend to use the calculator extensively, please follow the steps below in order to install it on your own computer. 

#### Access through RStudio

In order to run the effect size calculator on your own computer, you will need to install two pieces of software (R and RStudio), both of which are open-source and freely available. You will then need to follow several further steps to configure that software. The installation is more involved, but has the benefit of letting you run the tool as much as you want, at faster speeds than over the web. 

1. Install R from http://cran.r-project.org/
2. For Windows users, install Rtools from http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/
3. Install RStudio from http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
4. Once you have these programs installed, you will need to install several R packages that are required to run the calculator. Do this by typing the following commands at the console prompt:

    ```{r, eval=FALSE}
    install.packages("devtools")
    install.packages("sourcetools")
    install.packages("shiny")
    install.packages("markdown")
    install.packages("ggplot2")
    devtools::install_github("jepusto/SingleCaseES")
    ```

5. After all of these packages are installed, type the following commands at the console prompt to start the simulator (the simulator should then open in a new window):

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    library(SingleCaseES)
    SCD_effect_sizes()
    ```

6. To exit the calculator, close the window in which it appears and click the red "Stop" icon in the upper right-hand corner of the RStudio console window.
