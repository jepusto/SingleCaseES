# Single-entry Calculator

The single-entry calculator will estimate an effect size using data from a single 
series. To use the single-entry calculator with your own data, you must first enter 
fill in the Phase A field and the Phase B field. If you desire, you can check the
"Show graph" box to display a plot of the data you have entered.

You will then need to specify values for the following effect size options: 

- __Non-overlap__ or __Parametric__

- __Effect Size Index__

- __Direction of Improvement__ : If the desired effect size is a non-overlap index you will
  need to specify the expected direction of improvement.

- __Confidence Level__:  For non-overlap effect sizes that have standard errors, as well as all parametric 
  effect sizes you, the calculator will provide confidence intervals. You will need to specify what coverage
  you desire in your confidence interval. The default is 95% confidence intervals.
  
The single-entry calculator will display an effect size estimate, as well as a standard 
error  and confidence interval if applicable. If you are interested in the methods and references
for a given effect size, you can check the "Show methods and references" box for more details.
