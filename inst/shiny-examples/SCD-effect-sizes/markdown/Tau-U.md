#### Definition 

Tau-U is one of several effect sizes proposed by Parker, Vannest, Davis, and Sauber (2011). The Tau-U variant is similar to Tau, but includes an adjustment for baseline time trends. For an outcome where increase is desirable, the index is calculated as Kendall's $S$ statistic for the comparison between the phase B data and the phase A data, plus Kendall's $S$ statistic for the A phase observations, scaled by the product of the number of observations in each phase. 

This effect size does not have a stable parameter definition (Tarlow, 2017). 

#### Estimation

Let $y^A_1,...,y^A_m$ denote the observations from phase A. Let $y^B_1,...,y^B_n$ denote the observations from phase B. For an outcome where increase is desirable, calculate 

$$w^{AB}_{ij} = I(y^B_j > y^A_i) - I(y^B_j < y^A_i)$$

and 

$$w^{AA}_{ij} = I(y^A_j > y^A_i) - I(y^A_j < y^A_i)$$

(for an outcome where decrease is desirable, one would instead use $w^{AB}_{ij} = I(y^B_j < y^A_i) - I(y^B_j > y^A_i)$ and $w^{AA}_{ij} = I(y^A_j < y^A_i) - I(y^A_j > y^A_i)$). The effect size index is then calculated as

$$
\text{Tau-U} = \frac{1}{m n} \left(\sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^n w^{AB}_{ij} - \sum_{i=1}^{m - 1} \sum_{j=i + 1}^m w^{AA}_{ij}\right). 
$$
